=== Description ===

This library defines an Interpreter monad. It allows to load Haskell
modules, browse them, type-check and evaluate strings with Haskell
expressions and even coerce them into values. The library is
thread-safe and type-safe (even the coercion of expressions to
values).

It is, esentially, a huge subset of the GHC API wrapped in a simpler
API.


=== Documentation ===

The library cames with haddock documentation you can build
(see above). Also, check examples/example.hs to see a simple but
comprehensive example (it must be run from the examples
directory, since it expects to find the SomeModule.hs file
located there).
